The Resources line shows how much CPU time, memory, virtual memory,
and walltime was used. Exercises:

[[file:hist.png]]

- extract the wall time in minutes from each file using
  regex, and make a histogram of times over all files. How much is the
  average/min/max wall time?
- extract all four numbers from the Resources line
  (cput,mem,vmem,walltime) and make a single ggplot with four
  panels. Each panel should be the histogram for one of the four
  numbers. Hint: you should create a data table with columns variable
  and value, where value is numeric/double and variable is one of
  [cput_minutes, mem_kb, vmem_kb, walltime_minutes].
