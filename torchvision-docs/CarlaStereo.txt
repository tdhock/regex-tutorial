    The dataset is expected to have the following structure: ::

        root
            carla-highres
                trainingF
                    scene1
                        img0.png
                        img1.png
                        disp0GT.pfm
                        disp1GT.pfm
                        calib.txt
                    scene2
                        img0.png
                        img1.png
                        disp0GT.pfm
                        disp1GT.pfm
                        calib.txt
                    ...

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory where `carla-highres` is located.
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in a sample and returns a transformed version.
