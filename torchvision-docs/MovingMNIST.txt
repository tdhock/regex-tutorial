`MovingMNIST <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nitish/unsupervised_video/>`_ Dataset.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of dataset where ``MovingMNIST/mnist_test_seq.npy`` exists.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, supports ``None`` (default), ``"train"`` and ``"test"``.
            If ``split=None``, the full data is returned.
        split_ratio (int, optional): The split ratio of number of frames. If ``split="train"``, the first split
            frames ``data[:, :split_ratio]`` is returned. If ``split="test"``, the last split frames ``data[:, split_ratio:]``
            is returned. If ``split=None``, this parameter is ignored and the all frames data is returned.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in an torch Tensor
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        download (bool, optional): If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
