`FlyingThings3D <https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/SceneFlowDatasets.en.html>`_ dataset for optical flow.

    The dataset is expected to have the following structure: ::

        root
            FlyingThings3D
                frames_cleanpass
                    TEST
                    TRAIN
                frames_finalpass
                    TEST
                    TRAIN
                optical_flow
                    TEST
                    TRAIN

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the intel FlyingThings3D Dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, either "train" (default) or "test"
        pass_name (string, optional): The pass to use, either "clean" (default) or "final" or "both". See link above for
            details on the different passes.
        camera (string, optional): Which camera to return images from. Can be either "left" (default) or "right" or "both".
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in
            ``img1, img2, flow, valid_flow_mask`` and returns a transformed version.
            ``valid_flow_mask`` is expected for consistency with other datasets which
            return a built-in valid mask, such as :class:`~torchvision.datasets.KittiFlow`.
