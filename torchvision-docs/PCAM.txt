`PCAM Dataset   <https://github.com/basveeling/pcam>`_.

    The PatchCamelyon dataset is a binary classification dataset with 327,680
    color images (96px x 96px), extracted from histopathologic scans of lymph node
    sections. Each image is annotated with a binary label indicating presence of
    metastatic tissue.

    This dataset requires the ``h5py`` package which you can install with ``pip install h5py``.

    Args:
         root (string): Root directory of the dataset.
         split (string, optional): The dataset split, supports ``"train"`` (default), ``"test"`` or ``"val"``.
         transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in a PIL image and returns a transformed
             version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``.
         target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the target and transforms it.
         download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from the internet and puts it into ``root/pcam``. If
             dataset is already downloaded, it is not downloaded again.
