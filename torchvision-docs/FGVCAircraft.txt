`FGVC Aircraft <https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/fgvc-aircraft/>`_ Dataset.

    The dataset contains 10,000 images of aircraft, with 100 images for each of 100
    different aircraft model variants, most of which are airplanes.
    Aircraft models are organized in a three-levels hierarchy. The three levels, from
    finer to coarser, are:

    - ``variant``, e.g. Boeing 737-700. A variant collapses all the models that are visually
        indistinguishable into one class. The dataset comprises 100 different variants.
    - ``family``, e.g. Boeing 737. The dataset comprises 70 different families.
    - ``manufacturer``, e.g. Boeing. The dataset comprises 30 different manufacturers.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the FGVC Aircraft dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, supports ``train``, ``val``,
            ``trainval`` and ``test``.
        annotation_level (str, optional): The annotation level, supports ``variant``,
            ``family`` and ``manufacturer``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
