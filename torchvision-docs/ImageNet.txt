        Before using this class, it is required to download ImageNet 2012 dataset from
        `here <https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/2012-downloads.php>`_ and
        place the files ``ILSVRC2012_devkit_t12.tar.gz`` and ``ILSVRC2012_img_train.tar``
        or ``ILSVRC2012_img_val.tar`` based on ``split`` in the root directory.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the ImageNet Dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, supports ``train``, or ``val``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image

        class_to_idx (dict): Dict with items (class_name, class_index).
        wnids (list): List of the WordNet IDs.
        wnid_to_idx (dict): Dict with items (wordnet_id, class_index).
        imgs (list): List of (image path, class_index) tuples
        targets (list): The class_index value for each image in the dataset
