`Places365 <http://places2.csail.mit.edu/index.html>`_ classification dataset.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the Places365 dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split. Can be one of ``train-standard`` (default), ``train-challenge``,
            ``val``.
        small (bool, optional): If ``True``, uses the small images, i.e. resized to 256 x 256 pixels, instead of the
            high resolution ones.
        download (bool, optional): If ``True``, downloads the dataset components and places them in ``root``. Already
            downloaded archives are not downloaded again.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        loader (callable, optional): A function to load an image given its path.

     Attributes:
        classes (list): List of the class names.
        class_to_idx (dict): Dict with items (class_name, class_index).
        imgs (list): List of (image path, class_index) tuples
        targets (list): The class_index value for each image in the dataset

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If ``download is False`` and the meta files, i.e. the devkit, are not present or corrupted.
        RuntimeError: If ``download is True`` and the image archive is already extracted.
