`QMNIST <https://github.com/facebookresearch/qmnist>`_ Dataset.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of dataset whose ``raw``
            subdir contains binary files of the datasets.
        what (string,optional): Can be 'train', 'test', 'test10k',
            'test50k', or 'nist' for respectively the mnist compatible
            training set, the 60k qmnist testing set, the 10k qmnist
            examples that match the mnist testing set, the 50k
            remaining qmnist testing examples, or all the nist
            digits. The default is to select 'train' or 'test'
            according to the compatibility argument 'train'.
        compat (bool,optional): A boolean that says whether the target
            for each example is class number (for compatibility with
            the MNIST dataloader) or a torch vector containing the
            full qmnist information. Default=True.
        download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from
            the internet and puts it in root directory. If dataset is
            already downloaded, it is not downloaded again.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that
            takes in an PIL image and returns a transformed
            version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform
            that takes in the target and transforms it.
        train (bool,optional,compatibility): When argument 'what' is
            not specified, this boolean decides whether to load the
            training set or the testing set.  Default: True.
