`FlyingChairs <https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FlyingChairs.en.html#flyingchairs>`_ Dataset for optical flow.

    You will also need to download the FlyingChairs_train_val.txt file from the dataset page.

    The dataset is expected to have the following structure: ::

        root
            FlyingChairs
                data
                    00001_flow.flo
                    00001_img1.ppm
                    00001_img2.ppm
                    ...
                FlyingChairs_train_val.txt


    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the FlyingChairs Dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, either "train" (default) or "val"
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in
            ``img1, img2, flow, valid_flow_mask`` and returns a transformed version.
            ``valid_flow_mask`` is expected for consistency with other datasets which
            return a built-in valid mask, such as :class:`~torchvision.datasets.KittiFlow`.
