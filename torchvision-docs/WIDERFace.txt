`WIDERFace <http://shuoyang1213.me/WIDERFACE/>`_ Dataset.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory where images and annotations are downloaded to.
            Expects the following folder structure if download=False:

            .. code::

                <root>
                    └── widerface
                        ├── wider_face_split ('wider_face_split.zip' if compressed)
                        ├── WIDER_train ('WIDER_train.zip' if compressed)
                        ├── WIDER_val ('WIDER_val.zip' if compressed)
                        └── WIDER_test ('WIDER_test.zip' if compressed)
        split (string): The dataset split to use. One of {``train``, ``val``, ``test``}.
            Defaults to ``train``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in a PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
