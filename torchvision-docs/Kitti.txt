`KITTI <http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_object.php?obj_benchmark>`_ Dataset.

    It corresponds to the "left color images of object" dataset, for object detection.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory where images are downloaded to.
            Expects the following folder structure if download=False:

            .. code::

                <root>
                    └── Kitti
                        └─ raw
                            ├── training
                            |   ├── image_2
                            |   └── label_2
                            └── testing
                                └── image_2
        train (bool, optional): Use ``train`` split if true, else ``test`` split.
            Defaults to ``train``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in a PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.PILToTensor``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes input sample
            and its target as entry and returns a transformed version.
        download (bool, optional): If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
