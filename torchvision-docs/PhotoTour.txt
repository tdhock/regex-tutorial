`Multi-view Stereo Correspondence <http://matthewalunbrown.com/patchdata/patchdata.html>`_ Dataset.

    .. note::

        We only provide the newer version of the dataset, since the authors state that it

            is more suitable for training descriptors based on difference of Gaussian, or Harris corners, as the
            patches are centred on real interest point detections, rather than being projections of 3D points as is the
            case in the old dataset.

        The original dataset is available under http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/patches/default.htm.


    Args:
        root (string): Root directory where images are.
        name (string): Name of the dataset to load.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version.
        download (bool, optional): If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
