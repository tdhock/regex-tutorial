`STL10 <https://cs.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/>`_ Dataset.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of dataset where directory
            ``stl10_binary`` exists.
        split (string): One of {'train', 'test', 'unlabeled', 'train+unlabeled'}.
            Accordingly, dataset is selected.
        folds (int, optional): One of {0-9} or None.
            For training, loads one of the 10 pre-defined folds of 1k samples for the
            standard evaluation procedure. If no value is passed, loads the 5k samples.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
