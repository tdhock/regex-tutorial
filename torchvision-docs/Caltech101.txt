`Caltech 101 <https://data.caltech.edu/records/20086>`_ Dataset.

    .. warning::

        This class needs `scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/>`_ to load target files from `.mat` format.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of dataset where directory
            ``caltech101`` exists or will be saved to if download is set to True.
        target_type (string or list, optional): Type of target to use, ``category`` or
            ``annotation``. Can also be a list to output a tuple with all specified
            target types.  ``category`` represents the target class, and
            ``annotation`` is a list of points from a hand-generated outline.
            Defaults to ``category``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
