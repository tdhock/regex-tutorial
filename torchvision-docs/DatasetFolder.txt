        loader (callable): A function to load a sample given its path.
        extensions (tuple[string]): A list of allowed extensions.
            both extensions and is_valid_file should not be passed.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in
            a sample and returns a transformed version.
            E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop`` for images.

        class_to_idx (dict): Dict with items (class_name, class_index).
        samples (list): List of (sample path, class_index) tuples
        targets (list): The class_index value for each image in the dataset
