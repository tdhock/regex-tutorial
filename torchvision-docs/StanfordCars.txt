`Stanford Cars <https://ai.stanford.edu/~jkrause/cars/car_dataset.html>`_ Dataset

    The Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is
    split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class
    has been split roughly in a 50-50 split

    .. note::

        This class needs `scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/>`_ to load target files from `.mat` format.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of dataset
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, supports ``"train"`` (default) or ``"test"``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If True, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
