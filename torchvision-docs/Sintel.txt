`Sintel <http://sintel.is.tue.mpg.de/>`_ Dataset for optical flow.

    The dataset is expected to have the following structure: ::

        root
            Sintel
                testing
                    clean
                        scene_1
                        scene_2
                        ...
                    final
                        scene_1
                        scene_2
                        ...
                training
                    clean
                        scene_1
                        scene_2
                        ...
                    final
                        scene_1
                        scene_2
                        ...
                    flow
                        scene_1
                        scene_2
                        ...

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the Sintel Dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, either "train" (default) or "test"
        pass_name (string, optional): The pass to use, either "clean" (default), "final", or "both". See link above for
            details on the different passes.
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in
            ``img1, img2, flow, valid_flow_mask`` and returns a transformed version.
            ``valid_flow_mask`` is expected for consistency with other datasets which
            return a built-in valid mask, such as :class:`~torchvision.datasets.KittiFlow`.
