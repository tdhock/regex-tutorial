`KITTI <http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_scene_flow.php?benchmark=flow>`__ dataset for optical flow (2015).

    The dataset is expected to have the following structure: ::

        root
            KittiFlow
                testing
                    image_2
                training
                    image_2
                    flow_occ

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of the KittiFlow Dataset.
        split (string, optional): The dataset split, either "train" (default) or "test"
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in
            ``img1, img2, flow, valid_flow_mask`` and returns a transformed version.
