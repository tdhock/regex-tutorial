    Base Class For making datasets which are compatible with torchvision.
    It is necessary to override the ``__getitem__`` and ``__len__`` method.

    Args:
        root (string, optional): Root directory of dataset. Only used for `__repr__`.
        transforms (callable, optional): A function/transforms that takes in
            an image and a label and returns the transformed versions of both.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.

    .. note::

        :attr:`transforms` and the combination of :attr:`transform` and :attr:`target_transform` are mutually exclusive.
