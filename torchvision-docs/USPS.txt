`USPS <https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html#usps>`_ Dataset.
    The data-format is : [label [index:value ]*256 \n] * num_lines, where ``label`` lies in ``[1, 10]``.
    The value for each pixel lies in ``[-1, 1]``. Here we transform the ``label`` into ``[0, 9]``
    and make pixel values in ``[0, 255]``.

    Args:
        root (string): Root directory of dataset to store``USPS`` data files.
        train (bool, optional): If True, creates dataset from ``usps.bz2``,
            otherwise from ``usps.t.bz2``.
        transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that  takes in an PIL image
            and returns a transformed version. E.g, ``transforms.RandomCrop``
        target_transform (callable, optional): A function/transform that takes in the
            target and transforms it.
        download (bool, optional): If true, downloads the dataset from the internet and
            puts it in root directory. If dataset is already downloaded, it is not
            downloaded again.
