<p>This document describes the major elements (or fields) found on the MEDLINE display format for PubMed MEDLINE records. Some elements (e.g., Comment In) are not mandatory and will not appear in every record. Other elements (e.g., Author, MeSH term, Registry Number) may appear multiple times in one record. <strong><em>Some</em></strong> of the elements on this list are searchable fields in PubMed. For searching instructions, see the <a href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/#pubmedhelp.Search_Field_Descriptions_and">Search Field Tags section of PubMed Help</a>.

<hr /><!-- Abstract -->
<h3><strong><a id="ab" name="ab"></a>Abstract (AB)</strong></h3>
<p>English-language abstracts are as supplied by the publisher or taken directly from the published article. If the article does not have a published abstract, the National Library of Medicine does not create one, thus the record lacks the Abstract element. However, in the absence of a formally labeled abstract in the published article, text from a substantive "summary," "summary and conclusions," or "conclusions and summary" may be used.</p>
<p>All abstracts in the AB field are in English. For abstracts in other languages, see the &lt;OtherAbstract&gt; element in the XML or other display.</p>
<p>Publishers have given the National Library of Medicine permission to use abstracts for which they claim copyright. NLM does not hold copyright on the abstracts in MEDLINE. Users should obtain an opinion from their legal counsel for any use they plan for the abstracts in the database.</p>
<p>Generally, there are no abstracts for records created before 1975. However, starting in April 2007 NLM began to add abstracts from articles in <a href="//www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/">PubMed Central</a> (PMC) to the equivalent MEDLINE/PubMed citation record if that record does not already contain an abstract. The abstracts are derived from the <a href="//www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/about/scanning.html">PMC scanning project</a> which is digitizing the back issues of participating PMC journals. As a result, additional records published prior to 1975 will contain abstracts.<!-- UPDATE when back-scanning project makes this untrue.  --></p>
<p>If a collaborating data producer has created an abstract, it will appear in the <a href="#oab">Other Abstract (OAB)</a> field. This field may be used in addition to or instead of Abstract.</p>
<p>Because data entry policies at NLM have changed over the years, abstracts in some records may be truncated, in which case one of the following phrases may appear at the end of the text enclosed in parentheses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS<br />ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS<br />ABSTRACT TRUNCATED (This message occurred infrequently once the maximum length was raised to 4,096 characters in 1996.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Example:</strong><br />AB - Many disorders may result in delay of language. . . . . The reason for suggesting this diagnostic category is to stress that these children do initially behave in a similar way to those who are peripherally deaf. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)</p>
<p>Original policy on inclusion of abstracts set a limit of 250 words for acceptance. Effective with the January 1984 data (i.e., NLM's ELHILL legacy system 8401 Entry Month) two changes were made in this policy: 1) the word limit was expanded to 400 words for abstracts from articles ten pages or more in length or from articles in the core journals identified by the National Cancer Institute and 2) abstracts exceeding the 250- or 400-word limit were to be included in truncated form at the end of the sentence closest to the word limit. The maximum length of abstracts for records created between 2000 and 2016 was 10,000 characters. Abstracts are no longer truncated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The percentage of records with abstracts has increased over the years as more publishers gave permission for NLM to include these data. A chart showing the number of MEDLINE records containing abstracts in various segments of MEDLINE is available at: <a href="/bsd/medline_lang_distr.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/medline_lang_distr.html</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/bsd/policy/structured_abstracts.html">Structured abstracts</a>, describing key aspects of the purposes, methods, and results in a consistent way, are published in some journals. The key aspects of structured abstracts are capitalized to stand out, e.g., BACKGROUND, OBJECTIVES, METHOD, etc. Structured abstracts were not truncated in the past, even if they surpassed the previous 250 or 400 word limit.</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Example:</strong><br /> AB - BACKGROUND: Superantigens produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are among the most lethal of toxins. Toxins in this family trigger an excessive cellular immune response leading to toxic shock. OBJECTIVES: To design an antagonist that is effective in vivo against a broad spectrum of superantigen toxins. METHODS: Short peptide antagonists were selected for their ability to inhibit superantigen-induced expression of human genes for cytokines that mediate shock. The ability of these peptides to protect mice against lethal toxin challenge was examined. RESULTS: Antagonist peptide protected mice against lethal challenge with staphylococcal enterotoxin B and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, superantigens that share only 6% overall amino acid homology. Moreover, it rescued mice undergoing toxic shock. Antagonist peptides show homology to a beta-strand/hinge/alpha-helix domain that is structurally conserved among superantigens, yet remote from known binding sites for the major histocompatibility class II molecule and T cell receptor that function in toxic T cell hyperactivation. CONCLUSIONS: The lethal effect of superantigens can be blocked with a peptide antagonist that inhibits their action at the top of the toxicity cascade before activation of T cells occurs. Superantigenic toxin antagonists may serve not only as countermeasures to biologic warfare but may be useful in the treatment of staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic shock, as well as in some cases of septic shock.</p>

</table>
<p>Beginning in mid-2005, the various policy restrictions on number of author names entered in past years were lifted so that on an individual basis, a record may be edited to include all author names present in the published article, regardless of the limitation in effect at the time the record was first created.</p>
<p>Effective with 1992 date of publication, letters are indexed individually with authors rather than as an anonymous group.</p>
<p>Notes about transliteration of author names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until 1990, NLM transliterated up to five authors' Cyrillic or Japanese names to the Roman alphabet.</li>
<li>Between 1990 and 2016, the first ten Cyrillic or Japanese names are transliterated. Chinese ideograms were not transliterated by NLM, but if transliterations of the authors names are available in the journal article or table of contents, they were included in the citation, even if that includes only one author in a multi-author article.</li>
<li>Beginning in 2016, author names are published in Roman characters in all MEDLINE journals, and NLM no longer transliterates Cyrillic or Japanese names. All author names are included as published.</li>

<h3><strong><a id="fau" name="fau"></a>Full Author (FAU)</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning with articles with a publication year of 2002, PubMed records may include full names. BIOETHICSLINE citations converted to MEDLINE citations in late 2001 have full names on citations prior to publication year 2002; those data are found in the <a href="#GN">General Note (GN)</a> field. Citations from the Kennedy Institute of Ethics (KIE) may have full names in the Full Author field for publication dates of prior to 2002.</p>
<p>Full author names are entered when they appear in the author position of an article, usually on the title page of an article. If only the last name and initials appear in the author position, then only the last name and initials will be entered, even if a form of the fuller name appears elsewhere in the article or in the Table of Contents for the journal.</p>
<p>Author Initials:<br /> Initials data are generated from the Data Creation and Maintenance System (DCMS) ForeName data element using an algorithm. Here are the highlights of that algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only two initials are included. Initials are at the beginning of a name string or following a break (a space or hyphen). Only capital letters in the ForeName elements are candidates for initials, except for the letter following a hyphen. The letter following a hyphen is a candidate for an initial, unless the string following the hyphen is "ichi."</li>
<li>When the ForeName data element consists of only initials, there are spaces between initials.</li>
<li>An initial includes the following particles: da, de, del, do, dos, du, el, el-, and le. All particles except "el-" are followed by a space and are preceded by a space or are at the beginning of the name string. If found, all particles are converted to lower case when generated as part of the Initials data element.</li>
<li>If the language of the article is Bulgarian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian (Roman), or Ukranian, then one initial may be a 2- or 4-character transliterated mixed-case initial. Current, mixed-case transliteration values are: Dj, Lj, Nj, Ch, Sh, Iu, Ia, Ie, Zh, Kh, Ts, Dz, Shch.</li>

<p>Note that the end result of generating the Initials data is that the two initials are closed up with no space between, even though there may be spaces elsewhere in the Initials string if one or both of the initials has embedded spaces.</p>
<p>There are some author names that have no initials. These are mostly Malaysian names, for which the entire name is entered in the LastName field.</p>
<p>The full name will display on the PubMed MEDLINE display format above the respective name field as in the following example:</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Example:</strong><br />FAU - Foa, Edna B<br />AU - Foa EB</p>
<p>Note: When an author's name has been corrected from a published erratum, the corrected name is placed in the Author field and the incorrect name that was originally published is retained in the last occurrence of the Author field. In this case, there will be an associated commentary linkage.</p>
<p>NLM expended much effort to parse the data converted from the legacy ELHILL format at the end of the 2000 production year accurately. Many citations from the 1966-1974 timeframe were changed to follow data entry conventions established later. For example, particles such as "van der" were moved from the suffix position to the beginning of the last name, and the abbreviations "2d" and "3d" were changed to "2nd" and "3rd". It is possible to have particles associated with initials, such as "Mdel R" for "Mar&iacute;a del R". It is also possible to have only a last name. Some occurrences of author data in this category are in error and will be corrected manually as time permits.</p>
<p>For <a href="/databases/databases_oldmedline.html">OLDMEDLINE</a> records, every published author name is included in the list of authors for citations from the 1951 - 1959 <em>Current List of Medical Literature</em> (CLML) and for citations from the 1960 - 1965 <em>Cumulated Index Medicus</em> (CIM). For citations from the 1950 CLML, a maximum of three author names were entered. OLDMEDLINE first and last name author elements are in all upper case letters, except in some cases the particle is in lower case letters. A suffix is in upper and lower case letters. OLDMEDLINE records do not contain collective or corporate names. A small percentage of OLDMEDLINE records contain the last name only, because that is the only Author data present in the abstracting and indexing tool used to create the record.</p>

<p>From mid-November 2000&nbsp;to April 2006, the corporate author name displayed in PubMed citations as the last occurrence in the author field, as a separate data element after any personal names. Effective May 2006, the collective author is retained in the order of all authors found in the byline of the published article. See the <a href="//www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/techbull/mj06/mj06_corp_author.html">May-June 2006 Technical Bulletin article</a> for details.</p>
<p>Citations prior to 1966, in general, have no indication of collective author unless they were created by NLM's data creation partners. Citations from 1966 to 2000 with collective author field data contain that data in the Title field. These records are generally those created by NLM's data creation partners, and are very few in number and typically in the population or ethics subject areas. As they are encountered, these retrospective records may be individually maintained to move the Corporate Author information from the Title field to the Corporate Author field.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="dcom2" name="crdt"></a>Create Date (CRDT)</strong></h3>
<p>Create Date is the date the record was added to the database. Create Date was implemented with all PubMed records when the 2009 system became available on December 15, 2008. All records added to PubMed prior to implementation received a Create Date equal to <a href="#edat">Entrez Date (EDAT)</a>.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="dcom" name="dcom"></a>Date Completed (DCOM)</strong></h3>
<p>Date Completed is the date processing of the record ends; i.e., MeSH<sup>&reg;</sup> Headings have been added, quality assurance validations are completed, and the completed record subsequently is distributed to PubMed and licensees. This is contrasted with <a href="#da">Date Created</a>, which is the date processing begins.</p>
<p>Format: YYYYMMDD</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Example:</strong><br />DCOM - 20020207</p>
<p>In Process records lack the Date Completed field. For <a href="/databases/databases_oldmedline.html">OLDMEDLINE</a> records, the Date Completed is the approximate date the record entered PubMed, rather than the date processing ends. OLDMEDLINE records are created and processed differently than MEDLINE records.</p>
<hr />
<p><a href="#top">Table of Contents</a></p>
<hr /><!-- Date Created -->
<h3><strong><a id="da" name="da"></a>Date Created (DA)</strong></h3>
<p>Date Created is the date that processing of the record begins.</p>
<p>Format: YYYYMMDD</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Example:</strong><br />DA - 2002051</p>
<p>This is contrasted with <a href="#dcom">Date Completed</a>, which is the date processing ends. Date Created is not the same as NLM's PubMed <a href="#edat">Entrez Date</a> (EDAT), which is the date the record entered PubMed.</p>
<p>For citations up to about the year 2000, the Date Created (DA) and <a href="#dcom">Date Completed (DCOM)</a> data elements are identical. These dates were derived from NLM's legacy ELHILL system.</p>
<p>For <a href="/databases/databases_oldmedline.html">OLDMEDLINE</a> citations converted from the 1964 and 1965 <em>Index Medicus</em> (IM), Date Created represents the year and month the citations were printed in the monthly <em>Index Medicus</em>, and the day will always be "01". All other OLDMEDLINE records have a year based on the year of the printed index, the month is always "12" for December, and the day is always "01".</p>

<hr /><!-- Date Last Revised -->
<h3><strong><a id="lr" name="lr"></a>Date Last Revised (LR)</strong></h3>
<p>The Date Last Revised indicates the date a change is made to a record. Publisher-supplied and In Process records may be given an LR when <a href="#gr">Grant information</a> or <a href="#pmc">PMCIDs</a> are added to the record. This is done to facilitate the tracking of compliance for NIH Public Access. Completed (MEDLINE and PubMed-not-MEDLINE) records may be given an LR as a result of individual or global maintenance.</p>
<p>When the 10 million+ MEDLINE records through the 2000 production year were converted to XML from NLM's legacy ELHILL system, all records were assigned a Last Revision Date of 20001218 (December 18, 2000). Subsequently, many of these records have been or will be maintained and given a later LR date.</p>
<p>The nature and content of the revision is not indicated on the record. <br />Only the latest revision date is displayed.</p>

<hr /><!-- Grant Number-->
<h3><strong><a id="gr" name="gr"></a>Grant Number (GR)</strong></h3>
<p>This field was introduced in 1981 and is comprised of four parts (modified from three in December 2007 and reordered in 2009):</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Number</strong> contains the research grant or contract number (or both) that designates financial support by any agency of the United States Public Health Service, any institute of the National Institutes of Health, or other organization. The data are generally recorded exactly as they appear in the published article*; there is no attempt to standardize the numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Grant 2-letter code</strong> contains the 2-letter grant code or acronym.</li>
<li><strong>Agency</strong> includes the institute acronym or mnemonic in the case of US PHS institutes, or full organization name. As of 2009 this includes the agency's hierarchical structure from lower to higher entity, when known. For example NCI NIH HHS for National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services.</li>
<li><strong>Country</strong> contains the home country of the granting agency.</li>
</ol>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Examples:</strong><br />GR - LM0577/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States<br />GR - M0-1 RR07122/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States<br />GR - Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom<br />GR - 058423/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom<br />GR - 067427/z/02/z/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom</p>
<p>Grant numbers are added to the record in two ways: 1) by NLM Indexers who have verified the grant information as published and 2) via a submission from PubMed Central to MEDLINE/PubMed when grant data&nbsp;are provided via the <a href="//nihms.nih.gov/">NIH Manuscript System</a> (NIHMS) or other manuscript submission system (e.g., Europe PMC Plus).</p>
<p>A list of the possible values for the grant Acronym and Agency is available from: <a href="//www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/grant_acronym.html">//www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/grant_acronym.html</a>. Please see links at the bottom to announcements of the addition of various granting agencies.</p>
<p>Be advised that while NLM enters the grant number, acronym and agency values are derived by using a machine algorithm against the grant number string. This may result in some inaccurate derivations.</p>
<p>Through 1999, NLM entered up to three grant numbers for each record. Beginning in 2000, NLM began to transition to an unlimited number of grant numbers or contract numbers. Some MEDLINE citations from 2000 and 2001 may still be limited to three grant numbers or contract numbers, but beginning in 2002, NLM does not limit the number of grant numbers or contract numbers. Some collaborating partners record grant numbers for agencies outside the U.S. Public Health Service in the <a href="#gn">General Notes</a> field.</p>
<p>*In July 2006, NLM corrected a large number of NIH grant number prefixes which were entered with the letter O (e.g., RO1) rather than the number 0 (e.g., R01). This practice deviates with NLM's general policy that the data in the online citation match what is in the published article.</p>

<hr /><!-- Investigator -->
<h3><strong><a id="ir" name="ir"></a>Investigator Name (IR) and Full Investigator Name (FIR)</strong></h3>
<p>Beginning in March of the 2008 production year, Investigator Name and Full Investigator Name fields are used to contain personal names of individuals (e.g., collaborators and investigators) who are not authors of a paper but rather are listed in the paper as members of a collective/corporate group that is an author of the paper. The same name listed multiple times will be repeated because NLM cannot make assumptions as to whether those names are the same person.</p>
<p><a id="IR_nasa" name="IR_nasa"></a>These fields also reside on MEDLINE citations created or maintained by one of our former collaborating data producers, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). They identify the NASA-funded principal investigator(s) who conducted the research discussed in the article cited (but are not necessarily the authors). NASA Investigator Names are associated with the <a href="#irad">Investigator Affiliation</a> field.</p>
<p>See <a href="#au">Author</a> field for details on format. NLM's author indexing policy is explained in the <a href="/bsd/policy/authorship.html">Authorship in MEDLINE</a>.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="is" name="is"></a>ISSN (IS)</strong></h3>
<p>ISSN (International Standard Serial Number) is an eight-character value that uniquely identifies the cited journal. It is nine characters long in the hyphenated form: XXXX-XXXX. The ISSN field has a qualifier that follows the ISSN data which will state whether it is for the print or the electronic version ISSN of the journal. For journals with multiple ISSNs (e.g., those with separate ISSNs for the print and electronic versions), the ISSN in the MEDLINE citation reflects the version used for MeSH indexing.</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Examples:</strong><br />IS - 0021-5252 (Print)<br />IS - 1471-2202 (Electronic)</p>
<p>Some records do not contain an ISSN value.<br /><br />The complete title of the journal can be found in the <a href="#jt">Journal Title (JT)</a> field. See <a href="/bsd/pmresources.html#journals">more information about journals cited in MEDLINE</a>.</p>

<hr /><!-- MeSH Heading -->
<h3><strong><a id="mh" name="mh"></a>MeSH Terms (MH)</strong></h3>
<p>NLM's controlled vocabulary, Medical Subject Headings (MeSH<sup>&reg;</sup>), is used to characterize the content of the articles represented by MEDLINE citations.</p>
<p>Of the various MeSH headings assigned to a record, those representing the most significant points are identified with an asterisk (*) in the MeSH display. The remaining descriptors are used to identify concepts that have also been discussed in the item, but that are not the primary topics. In Process and publisher-supplied records lack MeSH terms. See the MeSH home page (<a href="/mesh/meshhome.html">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html</a>) for additional information about MeSH.</p>
<p>Subheadings (also known as Qualifiers) are often used with MeSH terms to help describe more completely a particular aspect of a subject. Subheadings are displayed after the MH and a slash (/). A major topic asterisk before a subheading indicates when the combination of that subheading with its associated MeSH term is a central concept of the article.</p>
<p>The presentation of MeSH terms is alphabetical. The Subheadings associated with a MeSH term are also in alphabetical order, without regard to the presence of the major topic asterisk (*).</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Example 1:</strong><br />MH - Adult<br />MH - Cardiovascular Diseases/etiology/*mortality<br />MH - Child Development/*physiology<br />MH - Embryo and Fetal Development/*physiology<br />MH - English Abstract<br />MH - Fetal Growth Retardation/complications/*physiopathology<br />MH - Human<br />MH - Infant, Newborn<br />MH - Nutrition<br />MH - Risk Factors<br />MH - Survival Rate</p>
<p>In the above example, the mortality aspect of cardiovascular diseases, the physiology of child development, as well as embryo and fetal development, and the physiopathology aspect of fetal growth retardation are the central concepts of the article. Note that the MeSH term English Abstract (also present in above example) means that a substantive English language abstract is present in the journal or was written by one of NLM's collaborating data producers. The abstract may or may not be present in the MEDLINE citation as the input policy changed over the years. There are many older non-English language citations without abstracts in MEDLINE but with the MeSH term English Abstract; this indicates that an English abstract is present in the journal, even if not a part of the online record.</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Example 2:</strong><br />MH - Animal<br />MH - Dogs<br />MH - *Myocardial Contraction<br />MH - Myocardium/*metabolism<br />MH - *Oxygen Consumption<br />MH - Surface Tension</p>
<p>In the above example, myocardial contraction, the metabolism aspect of myocardium, and oxygen consumption are the central concepts of the article.</p>
<p>There is an ongoing project to map original subject headings assigned to <a href="/databases/databases_oldmedline.html">OLDMEDLINE</a> records to current MeSH.&nbsp; Most of the terms assigned to OLDMEDLINE citations are identified as the major topic of the article. The original subject headings have been placed in the <a href="#OT">Other Term (OT)</a> field.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="oab" name="oab"></a>Other Abstract (OAB)</strong></h3>
<p>The Other Abstract field can contain an abstract that is written by someone other than the authors of the article.</p>
<p>NLM creates MEDLINE records without an Abstract field when the source journal article does not originally contain an abstract. In cases where a collaborating data partner provides an abstract, or an abstract is available following the journal publication, this abstract may appear in the Other Abstract field for that record. This field is associated with the Other Copyright Information (OCI) field, which displays beneath (OAB) if present. The abstract included in this field is not written by the authors of the article. The internal tracking number of the source document used by the collaborating partner resides in the <a href="#oid">Other ID</a> field.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="pt" name="pt"></a>Publication Type (PT)</strong></h3>
<p>This field describes the type of material that the article represents; it characterizes the nature of the information or the manner in which it is conveyed (e.g., Review, Letter, Retracted Publication, Clinical Trial). Records may contain more than one Publication Type, which are listed in alphabetical order.</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Examples:</strong><br />PT - Multicenter Study<br />PT - Review</p>
<p>Almost all citations have one of these four basic, most frequently used Publication Types applied to them: Journal Article, Letter, Editorial, News. One of the above four Publication Types is applied to more than 99% of all citations indexed for MEDLINE.</p>
<p>A <a href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK3827/table/pubmedhelp.T.publication_types/">list of the Publication Types</a> is available from PubMed Help. A list with definitions is available at <a href="/mesh/pubtypes.html">//www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/pubtypes.html</a>. Publication Types are also available in the MeSH Database at <a href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh">//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh</a>.</p>
<p>Some Publication Types have similar main headings equivalents in MeSH. In 2008, the form of similar main headings was modified to include &ldquo;AS TOPIC&rdquo;. For example, the Publication Type CLINICAL TRIAL has a similar MeSH heading CLINICAL TRIALS AS TOPIC.</p>
<p>Historical Notes:</p>
<p>Five citation types were used to describe various types of articles in MEDLARS before 1991. These were HISTORICAL ARTICLE, HISTORICAL BIOGRAPHY, CURRENT BIOGRAPHY-OBITUARY, MONOGRAPH and REVIEW. MONOGRAPHS were chosen for indexing in Index Medicus only from 1976 through 1981. Indexers were expected to identify each of these citation types during the indexing process.</p>
<p>In 1991 these citation types were replaced with a new MEDLARS data element called Publication Type (PT). The number of publication types was expanded to include types which are indexed for other NLM databases in addition to Index Medicus and MEDLINE.<br />All of the rubrics used to qualify titles have also become publication types.</p>
<p>At the request of the History of Medicine Division of NLM the list of publication types was expanded in 1997 to include 34 "genre terms" to describe the intellectual or literary type of presentation. These are used chiefly by catalogers and indexers for HISTLINE, rather than by indexers for Index Medicus and MEDLINE.</p>
<p>Every item indexed from 1991 forward is described by one or more of the Publication Types.</p>
<p>Beginning in October 2017, publishers are permitted to include publication types in their records provided to NLM. These publication types are verified during the MEDLINE indexing process. Records in PubMed that are not MEDLINE may have incomplete or inaccurate publication types.</p>

<hr /><!-- Secondary Source ID -->
<h3><strong><a id="si" name="si"></a>Secondary Source ID (SI)</strong></h3>
<p>The SI field contains information pertaining to many types of data discussed in MEDLINE articles, including: a) molecular sequence data; b) gene expression/molecular abundance data (beginning February 2006); c) clinical trial numbers (beginning summer 2005); d) PubChem identifiers (beginning in January 2007) e) BioProject identifiers (beginning in Summer 2014) and f) identifiers for other scientific data repositories (beginning in Summer 2014). The field is composed of the source followed by a slash followed by an accession number. See a <a href="/bsd/medline_databank_source.html">complete list of databank sources</a> included in the SI field.</p>
<p class="examplekm"><strong>Examples:</strong><br />SI - GENBANK/AF306859<br />SI - SWISSPROT/P13209<br />SI - ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT00000419<br />SI - GEO/GDS275<br />SI - PubChem-Substance/17424970</p>
<p><strong>Molecular Sequence Data</strong></p>
<p>NLM cooperates with international efforts to collect molecular sequence data. There are numerous databanks that register molecular sequences deposited with them by researchers. In 1988, NLM began with 7 databanks and added 8 more in 2014. In the journal literature, a reference to the databank and the accession number assigned to the sequence may accompany, or substitute for, a lengthy graphic representation of the sequence itself. The Secondary Source field is populated if this information appears in the journal article.There is no attempt to edit or verify the databank accession numbers that appear in the journal. Since sequences may be deposited with more than one databank, there may be multiple occurrences of SI associated with a single article. This information may appear on the article title page, in a footnote or in a statement such as: Sequence data from this article have been deposited with the EMBL, GenBank and DDBJ Data Libraries under Accession No. M16978.<br /><br />NLM first began to include molecular sequence data with the 1988 indexing year. Prior to 2000, the NLM policy was to enter up to 30 databank accession numbers for each record. Some global maintenance was done over the years to add databank names/accession numbers whether or not the article itself contained those references. From 2000 forward, NLM enters all databank accession numbers published in the journal.</p>
<p><strong>Clinical Trial Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in summer 2005, NLM includes the <a href="//clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a> identifier number in the SI field when the article is devoted solely and entirely to announcing or reporting the results of the clinical trial. The <a href="//www.icmje.org/">ICMJE Web site</a> contains an editorial and updates on the topic of registering clinical trials before publication of the results. <br /><br />Beginning mid-2006, MEDLINE citations also carry the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) when the article is devoted solely and entirely to announcing or reporting the results of the clinical trial or other study that the Identifier Number represents. The ISRCTN Register is a clinical trials deposit site based in the UK that meets the criteria set forth by the ICMJE (International Committee of Medical Journal Editors) for responsible disclosure of information to the public. The letters ISRCTN are a part of the trial number. Retrospective maintenance was taken on existing citations in MedlineCitation status = MEDLINE to add ISRCTN numbers if an existing citation's article title or abstract contained that data.<br /><br />Beginning in 2014, MEDLINE citations also carry identifier numbers for many of the primary registries in the <a href="//www.who.int/ictrp/network/primary/en/index.html">World Health Organization (WHO) Registry Network</a> when the article is devoted solely and entirely to announcing or reporting the results of the clinical trial or other study that the identifier number represents.<br /><br /><strong>Gene Expression Data</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in February 2006, accession numbers for data deposited in NLM&rsquo;s <a href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">Gene Expression Omnibus</a> (GEO) database are included in SI field. GEO is a gene expression/molecular abundance repository supporting data submissions, and a curated, online resource for gene expression data browsing, query and retrieval.</p>
<p>The databank abbreviation is GEO and the accession number is any one of four prefixes followed by a numeric string:</p>
<p>GDSxxxx (GEO Data Set)<br />GSExxxx (GEO SEries)<br />GPLxxxx (GEO PLatform)<br />GSMxxxx (GEO SaMple)</p>
<p><strong>PubChem Identifiers</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in January 2007, identifiers for records in the <a href="//pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> Substance database may be included in the SI field when the data are included in the citation XML feeds from the publishers. The <a href="//pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">PubChem</a> project provides information on the biological activities of small molecules and its overall goal is to identify new and safer drug therapies. There are three PubChem databases: PubChem Substance, PubChem Compound, and PubChem-BioAssay. Each record in each database has a unique identifier, consisting of one or more numerical characters. The abbreviation is PubChem-Substance and the accession number is a numeric string, e.g. 10318689. In 2014, identifiers for PubChem Compound and PubChem BioAssay records may also be added to MEDLINE/PubMed records.</p>
<p><strong>BioProject Identifiers</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in Summer 2014, identifiers for projects profiled in the NCBI <a href="//www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/">BioProject</a> database may be included in the SI field. A BioProject is a collection of biological data related to a single initiative, originating from a single organization or from a consortium. A BioProject record provides users a single place to find links to the diverse data types generated for that project.</p>
<p><strong>Other Scientific Data Repository Identifiers</strong></p>
<p>Beginning in Summer 2014, dataset accession numbers in the <a href="http://www.datadryad.org/">Dryad Digital Repository</a> and <a href="http://figshare.com/">figshare</a> may be included in the SI field. The Dryad and figshare repositories support wide varieties of datatypes and are not limited to specific scientific disciplines.

<h3><strong><a id="so" name="so"></a>Source (SO)</strong></h3>
<p>NLM concatenates the following elements to create the journal source:<br /><br />Journal Title Abbreviation (TA)<br />Publication Date (DP) or Date of Electronic Publication (DEP)<br />Volume (VI)<br />Issue (IP)<br />Pagination (PG)</p>
<p>Whether the source field contains the DP or the DEP date depends on the PubModel values, which are derived from data supplied by the publisher. If the DEP field is used the month value is displayed as a 3-character abbreviation.&nbsp; The PubModel can be found on the XML display.</p>
<p>Depending on the PubModel, the source can be followed by a note showing another date.&nbsp; The date is preceded by one of these labels:<br />Epub<br />Print<br />eCollection</p>
<p>ELocation ID data may also be added in addition to pagination or, if normal pagination data is not included, in place of pagination.</p>

<hr /><!-- Status -->
<h3><strong><a id="stat" name="stat"></a>Status (STAT)</strong></h3>
<p>The status field indicates the status of the record. There are seven possible values for this field:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In-Data-Review:</strong> Records in this status have been submitted to NLM electronically by the publisher, and the journal title, date of publication and volume/issue (source data) are being checked. The source data is either:<br />
<ol>
<li>matched to the print copy in NLM's collection and are correct;</li>
<li>matched to the online version of the journal (when NLM assigns MeSH headings from the online version) and are correct; or</li>
<li>compared to previously checked-in issues and appear to match the pattern or have been changed to match the established pattern. In these cases, the physical item has not yet been received for NLM's collection and the data have not been positively verified and may still change during NLM's processing cycle.</li>
</ol>
<br />While all three reviews are at the issue level, most citations fit into the last condition above. It is possible that the source information may be changed at a later point in the NLM quality assurance cycle once the hard copy issue is available for exact comparison.<br /><br />In-Data-Review records lack a <a href="#dcom">Date Completed</a> field. They are not yet MEDLINE records because they have not undergone complete quality review and MeSH indexing. The issue level review for In-Data-Review status is the first step in quality control. The records will typically either be reissued as In-process status records or go to PubMed-not-MEDLINE final record status.</li>
<li><strong>In-Process:</strong> Records in this status are undergoing a citation level review; i.e., the author names, article title, and pagination are being checked.<br /><br />In-process records do not have a <a href="#dcom">Date Completed</a> field, however, they do contain the <a href="#sb">Subset</a> field. In-process records are not yet MEDLINE records because they have not undergone complete quality review and MeSH indexing.<br /><br />Most in-process records are eventually indexed with MeSH terms and are elevated to completed MEDLINE status. However, some are determined to be out of scope (e.g., articles on plate tectonics or astrophysics from certain MEDLINE journals, primarily general science and chemistry journals, for which the life sciences articles are indexed for MEDLINE) and are not elevated to MEDLINE status; instead they become PubMed-not-Medline final status records. In rare cases the records are deleted and do not become PubMed-not-MEDLINE records.</li>
<li><strong>MEDLINE:</strong> In-process records undergo rigorous quality assurance routines before they are elevated to MEDLINE status or to PubMed-not-MEDLINE status.<br /><br />Records in MEDLINE status are the only 'true' MEDLINE records in PubMed. They contain <a href="#dcom">Date Completed</a> and <a href="#sb">Subset</a> fields and, in most cases, contain MeSH terms. MEDLINE records that are Retractions of Publications (see <a href="#pt">Publication Type</a> element) are exceptions and do not contain MeSH terms.</li>
<li><strong>OLDMEDLINE:</strong> Citations from the <a href="#sb">OLDMEDLINE</a> subset begin in OLDMEDLINE status. Once <em>all</em> of the original subject terms from the printed index have been mapped to current MeSH, the citation status is changed to MEDLINE. See <a href="/databases/databases_oldmedline.html">more information</a> about OLDMEDLINE.</li>
<li><strong>PubMed-not-MEDLINE:</strong> Records in this status are from journals included in MEDLINE and have undergone quality review but are not assigned MeSH headings because the cited item is not in scope for MEDLINE either by topic or by date of publication, or is from a non-MEDLINE journal. The categories of non-MEDLINE records in this status are:<br />
<ol>
<li>citations to articles that precede the date a journal was selected for MEDLINE indexing and are submitted for inclusion in PubMed after July 2003;</li>
<li>out of scope citations to articles in journals covered by MEDLINE;</li>
<li>analytical summaries of articles published elsewhere (see the article, "<a href="/pubs/techbull/mj02/mj02_ebm.html">Linking MEDLINE Citations to Evidence-Based Medicine Assessments and Summaries</a>", in the May-Jun 2002 <em>NLM Technical Bulletin</em>, page e2); and</li>
<li>(starting in the Summer of 2005) prospective citations to articles from non-MEDLINE journals that submit full text to PubMed Central<sup>&reg;</sup>, and are thus cited in PubMed.</li>
</ol>
<br />PubMed-not-MEDLINE records contain a <a href="#dcom">Date Completed</a> field and lack <a href="#sb">Subset</a> and <a href="#mh">MeSH term</a> fields.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Publisher:</strong> The non-MEDLINE records in Publisher Status in PubMed contain the notation [PubMed - as supplied by publisher] in the PubMed display. At this time the records in Publisher Status are:<br />
<ol>
<li>the retrospective records (prior to July 2005) for the relatively few non-MEDLINE journals in PubMed;</li>
<li>the retrospective records for MEDLINE journals prior to date of selection for MEDLINE and that were submitted electronically by the publishers before late July 2003;</li>
<li>the prospective records for currently indexed journals when the publisher has submitted an issue's citation data electronically and NLM still awaits its print copy or access to the electronic copy to use for issue level review (i.e., the journal title, date of publication and volume/issue elements) AND the publisher-supplied record contains a validation error of some kind that prevents it from being exported from NLM's Data Creation and Maintenance System (DCMS) along with the records not containing errors from the same issue. If there were no errors, the record would move to In-Data-Review status right away and be exported. In these cases, however, NLM staff must take corrective action before the record can be elevated to In-Data-Review status for export; and</li>
<li>citations electronically submitted for articles that appear on the Web in advance of the journal issue's release (i.e., ahead of print citations). Following publication of the completed issue, the item will be queued for issue level review and released in In-Data-Review status.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<hr /><!-- Subset -->
<h3><strong><a id="sb" name="sb"></a>Subset (SB)</strong></h3>
<p>This field identifies the subset for MEDLINE records from certain journal lists or records on specialized topics. Some of these values are found on extremely small numbers of records. Citations may contain more than one occurrence of this field. The value is true at the time the record was created. If the status of a journal changes, the value on the record does not change.</p>
<p>Subset field values and their definitions are as follows. Note that several are closed subsets no longer being assigned.</p>

<hr /><!-- Transliterated Title -->
<h3><strong><a id="ti" name="ti"></a>Title (TI)</strong></h3>
<p>The title field contains the entire title of the journal article, sometimes translated to English when the original article title is in another language. Those titles originally published in a non-English language and translated to English are enclosed in square brackets. All titles end with a period unless another punctuation mark such as a question mark or bracket is present. Explanatory information about the title itself is enclosed in parentheses, e.g.: (author's transl). <a href="#cn">Corporate/collective authors</a> may appear at the end of this field for citations up to about the year 2000.</p>
<p>NOTE: The publisher of the original article may edit this field in PubMed data at any time.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>TI - The Kleine-Levin syndrome as a neuropsychiatric disorder: a case report.<br /> TI - Why is xenon not more widely used for anaesthesia?<br /> TI - [Biological rhythms and human disease]<br /> TI - [The effect of anti-arrhythmic drugs on myocardial function (author's transl)]<br /> TI - Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori resistance to antibiotics in Northeast Italy: a multicentre study.
