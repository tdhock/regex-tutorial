In R =data.table= consistent style in variable names is important, and
in Aug 2024 there was a discussion which involved categorizing the
styles of arguments.

- "simple" means the argument is only one word/letter (no need for choice between camel/simple/R/etc)
- "abbrev" means one word (abbreviated).
- "acronym" means several words abbreviated using the first letter of each word.
- "minimal" means more than one word (possibly abbreviated), no space between.
- "dot" means . instead of space.
- "camel" means capitalize first letter of word instead of space.

Exercise for the reader: write R regex code to compute the styles of
each argument, and make sure that your computation is the same as the
=expected= column in [[file:expected.R]]. Hint: you will have to use a
dictionary of words, abbreviations, acronyms.
