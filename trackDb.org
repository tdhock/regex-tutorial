The [[file:trackDb.txt]] and [[file:trackDb2.txt]] are plain text meta-data
files with entries such as

#+begin_src
  track bcell_McGill0322Coverage
  bigDataUrl http://hubs.hpc.mcgill.ca/~thocking/PeakSegFPOP-labels/H3K36me3_TDH_immune/samples/bcell/McGill0322/coverage.bigWig
  shortLabel bcell_McGill0322Coverage
  longLabel bcell | McGill0322 | Coverage
  parent bcell_McGill0322
  type bigWig
  color 141,211,199
#+end_src

For each file, find the blocks such as the one above, of type bigWig,
and then count how many blocks of each cell type (which is the prefix
in parent/shortLabel, bcell in the example above).
