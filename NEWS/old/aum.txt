TODOs

2022.2.7

Add arXiv link to DESCRIPTION, clarify outputs in aum_diffs.

2022.2.3

Remove un-necessary C++ code, just keep aum_sort and interface.

2022.1.27

rename test file.

2021.9.23

aum_sort.cpp: fix read out of bound when err_N=1, use std::sort
instead of qsort.

2021.3.9

vignette comparing logistic regression and other loss functions to aum
minimization.

2021.3.2

Use qsort (standard C) instead of qsort_r (not standard).

2021.2.20

error checking for min.lambda values input to aum_diffs_penalty.

new aum_sort_interface C++ function (faster), older function renamed
to aum_map_interface, separate source and header files.

2021.2.16

aum supports names for predictions (copied to row names of
derivative_mat).

2021.2.15

more C++ error checking / tests.

vignette comparing speed with penaltyLearning::ROChange.

2021.2.14

aum_diffs, aum_diffs_binary, aum_diffs_penalty for creating error
diffs data frame required for input to aum.

aum_errors for converting aum_diffs to canonical error functions
(which start at fp=0 and end at fn=0). plot.aum_diffs uses this to
show a default plot of the error functions.

fn.not.zero example data taken from feaure-learning-benchmark.

2021.2.12

First draft.
