TODOs

2022.2.23

error if label start = end.

Rcpp errors contain more details about FLOPART_data() etc.

2022.2.22

FLOPART_interface returns segments table with 0 rows if there is
infinite cost (no feasible model given label constraints).

2022.2.15

FLOPART_data error if missing counts.

Include compression in FLOPART_data.

2022.1.27

FLOPART now works if annotation column of label data table is a factor
(previously only worked if it was character).

2021.4.28

Rcpp instead of .C for C++ interface.

export new R functions: get_label_code, FLOPART_interface,
FLOPART_data, FLOPART.

2021.4.27

new C++ classes CostMatrix and MinimizeResult with helpful methods
that make the code easier to read/understanding (especially decoding).
